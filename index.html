    <h1>Hi there.</h1>

    <p>I’m Frank Müller-Pierstorff — or just Franko, Fränk, Fna... people like to invent names. I live in Berlin. I design, teach, advise, and build.</p>

    <p>My work begins with a question: What brings people closer — to each other, to themselves, to what matters?</p>

    <p>I’m the founder of Obvious — a hands-on practice where purpose turns into strategy, and brand, product, and experience align. I work 1:1 with founders, leaders, and creators when the stakes are real and the way forward is still taking shape.</p>

    <p>I’ve taken startups from idea to outcome — and all the way to multi-million dollar exits. I’ve helped global companies like BCG rediscover who they are — and what they could become. When things are in motion, I come in. Not to control the shift, but to give it direction.</p>

    <p>I've learned that the most resilient companies are not built on theory alone — but by people who care, who see clearly, and who are brave enough to challenge what no longer fits.</p>

    <p>Right now, I’m exploring how design changes when intelligence becomes artificial. What remains human. What disappears. What begins. It’s not just a technical shift — it’s an emotional one. And I’m listening carefully.</p>

    <p>When I’m not working, I’m with my family. Reading. Walking. Moving. I love hand-poured coffee, art in all its forms, and making electronic music late at night.</p>

    <p>If something here resonates — if you’re building, shifting, or simply wondering — <a href="mailto:frankmuellerpierstorff@gmail.com">reach out</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankmuellerpierstorff" target="_blank">connect on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
