  <h1>Hi there.</h1>

  <p>
    I’m Frank Müller-Pierstorff — or just Franko, Fränk, Fna… people like to invent names. I live in Berlin. I design, teach, advise, and build.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work begins with a question:<br>
    <em>What brings people closer — to each other, to themselves, to what matters?</em><br>
    That question has shaped products, teams, and cultures I’ve created. It continues to shape how I lead, listen, and make.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve taken startups from idea to outcome — and all the way to multi million dollar exits. I’ve helped global companies like BCG rediscover who they are — and what they could become. When things are in motion, I come in. Not to control the shift, but to give it direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m the founder of Obvious — a hands-on practice where purpose turns into strategy, and brand, product, and experience align. I work 1:1 with founders, leaders, and creators when the stakes are real and the way forward is still taking shape.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, I’m exploring how design changes when intelligence becomes artificial. What remains human. What disappears. What begins.<br>
    It’s not just a technical shift — it’s an emotional one. And I’m listening carefully.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve learned that the most resilient companies are not built on spreadsheets alone. They are made by people who care, who see clearly, and who are brave enough to challenge what no longer fits. That’s the kind of work I seek — and the kind of people I seek it with.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not working, I’m with my family. Reading. Walking. Moving.<br>
    I love pour-over coffee, art in all its forms, and making electronic music late at night.
  </p>

  <p>
    If something here resonates — if you’re building, shifting, or simply wondering — reach out. Ask a question. Or let’s meet for a coffee.
