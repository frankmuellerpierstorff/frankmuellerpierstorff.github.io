  <p><h1>Hello.</h1> I’m Frank Müller-Pierstorff — a creative, entrepreneur, and investor based in Berlin.</p>

  <p>My work gravitates around one phenomenon that continues to fascinate me: flow. The moments when people are fully present — with themselves, with each other, with what matters most. That pursuit has guided the companies, products, and cultures I’ve helped shape. It still guides how I listen, lead, and make.</p>

  <p>I’ve taken startups from spark to scale — from first idea to lasting impact. I was Global Creative Director at <a href="https://www.bcg.com" target="_blank">BCG</a>, guiding 500+ designers worldwide, leading the company’s purpose work and full rebranding, and helping one of the world’s leading consultancies rediscover who they are — and what they could become. As a TED alumni, I’ve shared these ideas with communities that thrive on change. When momentum builds, I step in to give it direction.</p>

  <p>I’m the founder and CEO of <a href="https://thisisobvious.com/" target="_blank">Obvious</a> — an advisory studio helping leaders shape identity, design meaningful experiences, and move strategy into action. I work with founders, executives, and boards at pivotal moments — when clarity and courage matter most.</p>

  <p>I’ve learned that lasting companies don’t grow from decks and plans. They’re built by people who care deeply, see clearly, and dare to replace what no longer fits. That’s the kind of work I seek — and the kind of people I seek it with.</p>

  <p>Right now, I’m exploring how creativity evolves as intelligence becomes more than human. What endures. What vanishes. What begins. It’s not just a technical shift — it reshapes how we think, feel, create and flow.</p>

  <p>When I’m not working, I’m with my family — chasing light, ideas, or each other through the trees. I meditate to reset. I love hand-brewed coffee, all forms of art, and making electronic music late at night — when flow comes easiest.</p>
