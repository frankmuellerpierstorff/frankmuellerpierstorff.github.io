    <h1>Hello.</h1>

<p>I’m Frank Müller-Pierstorff — a designer, advisor, and educator based in Berlin.</p>

<p>My work begins with a question: What brings people closer — to each other, to themselves, to what matters?That question has shaped the brands, products, teams, and cultures I’ve helped create. It still shapes how I lead, listen, and make.</p>

<p>I’ve taken startups from idea to outcome — from purpose to impact, from zero to multi-million dollar exits. I’ve helped global companies like <a href="www.bcg.com">BCG</a> rediscover who they are — and what they could become. When things are in motion, I come in. Not to control the shift, but to give it direction.</p>

<p>I’m the founder and CEO of <a href="mailto:frankmuellerpierstorff@gmail.com">Obvious</a> — a hands-on clarity practice focused on brand building, experience design, and strategic execution. I work closely with founders, executives, and boards at pivotal, high-stakes moments.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m exploring how design changes when intelligence becomes artificial. What remains human. What disappears. What begins.It’s not just a technical shift — it’s an emotional one. And I’m listening carefully.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that the most resilient companies aren’t built on strategy decks alone. They’re built by people who care, who see clearly, and who are brave enough to challenge what no longer fits. That’s the kind of work I seek — and the kind of people I seek it with.</p>

<p>’m often with my family — chasing ideas, daylight, or each other through the trees. I meditate to keep my mind and body clear. I love hand-brewed coffee, all forms of art, and making electronic music late at night — when the world is quiet.</p>

<p>If something here resonates — if you’re building, shifting, or simply wondering — <a href="mailto:frankmuellerpierstorff@gmail.com">reach out</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankmuellerpierstorff" target="_blank">connect on LinkedIn</a>, or grab a coffee.</p>
